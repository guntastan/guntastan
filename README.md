computer science graduate from bilkent university (honours), currently working as a platform architecture / data application architecture engineer in the banking domain.

i am part of a core platform team responsible for building and maintaining common components, libraries, frameworks and shared data solutions used across the organization. my work focuses on reliability, performance and long-term maintainability, with attention to abstraction boundaries and system behavior under load.

---

## current focus

my day-to-day work involves designing and implementing platform-level building blocks such as:

- common frameworks and internal libraries
- shared data solutions (eventing, caching, and nosql-based components), designed for multi-tenant use
- infrastructure-facing components consumed by multiple engineering teams

production systems are primarily built using java within the spring ecosystem. 
i also actively work with c++ for systems-oriented and performance-critical development (primarily through personal projects).

---

## technical interests

- operating systems and concurrency
- computer networks and distributed systems
- event-driven and asynchronous architectures
- caching, data locality, and performance tuning
- deterministic and real time low-latency systems
- api, framework, and platform design at scale

i am most interested in problems where correctness, timing guarantees, and clarity of design are first-order concerns.
